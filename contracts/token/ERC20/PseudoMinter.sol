/**
 * @title PseudoMinter
 * @dev Proxy contract providing the necessary minting abbilities needed
 * within crowdsale contracts to ERC20 token contracts with a pre minted
 * fixed amount of tokens.
 * PseudoMinter is initialized with the token contract and the vault contract
 * which provides the spendable tokens. Cap is automatically set by approving
 * to the PseudoMinter instance the chosen amount of tokens.  Be aware that
 * this does not necessarily represent the hard cap of spendable tokens. If
 * vault can arbitrarily call the tokens approve function, this might even
 * be a security risk since the cap can be manipulated at will. Best practice
 * is to design vault as a contract with limited ablity to call the tokens
 * approve function.
 * For an example implementation see contracts/example/PreMintedCrowdsale.sol
